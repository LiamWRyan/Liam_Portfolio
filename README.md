### Goals

Develop an android application that could be fitted to any businesses scheduling needs. In its current state it is fitted to the following needs for a fast food restaurant, whose scheduling manager is our product manager. They requested the following process and outcomes (start quote):

> __Business Processes__
> - From Monday to Friday, the restaurant has two shifts, morning shift and afternoon shift. On Saturday and Sunday, the restaurant has one shift, a full-day shift. Two students are required for each shift. Occasionally, on some busy days (e.g. before Christmas), three students are required.
> - Students work in the morning shifts responsible for restaurant opening. Students work in the afternoon shifts responsible for restaurant closing. Students work in the full-day shifts responsible for opening and closing.
> - There are different processes for opening and closing. New hires will be trained for opening and closing, when opportunities are allowed. After new hires are trained for opening or closing, I will test them for the opening or closing process. If they pass, then they qualify for opening or closing.
> - Each morning shift should have at least one student qualified for opening. Each afternoon shift should have at least one student qualified for closing. Each full-day shift should have at least one student qualified for both opening and closing.
> - One week before the beginning of each month, all students email me the shifts that they are available for the month. I write down their availabilities on paper. Then, create the monthly shift schedule on paper. Picture of the monthly schedule is emailed to all students. The monthly schedule is then posted in the restaurant.
> - For each available student, they should have at least one shift per week.
> - If there is any change to the monthly schedule, I will communicate with the corresponding students, and update the posted schedule.
> 
> __Desired Outcomes__
> - A standalone Android app to be installed on an Android phone.
> - The app works without connecting to the Internet.
> - The app helps me to perform the business processes.
> - The app should be easy to use.
> - I will continue using emails to compliment the processes
