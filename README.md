# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
(This is in the progress of being built, I have several projects I have yet to add)

<details><summary> Code Projects</summary>

<!---PROJECT 1 -->
## [Project 1: Android Scheduling Application.](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/w21goldwasser) 

### Scheduling Application: Team Goldwasser (Winter 2021) 
  #### An Android application for a food court business that will allow the manager to build and view an employee schedules and deliver that schedule to said        employees. Github does not allow you to change the visibility of a fork, as such, here is a link to a video of the application https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfYn4Q1W5PI.
  
  
<!---PROJECT 1.5 -->

## [Project 1.5: Custom Mail Transfer Protocol](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/Simple-Mail-Transfer-Server-Client)

### Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Client & Server (Fall 2020)
  #### A python application which handles all the logic for a SMTP client and server. Here is a video outling the functionality of this application https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5VPWlOsfaw.

<!---PROJECT 2 -->          
## [Project 2: Property Assessment GUI.](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/PropertyAssessmentGUI) 

### Edmonton Property Assessment GUI (Fall 2021)
  #### a Java based GUI that supports the various querying of property assessments in Edmonton using Edmontons Open Data Portal API.

<!---PROJECT 3 -->
## [Project 3: Dash & Plotly Information Visualization Web Application](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/StubEnhancer) 

### Stubenhancer (Fall 2022)
  #### The objective of our application is to help our target audience make informed education and career decisions. We do this through interactive visualizations that abstracts the relevant data in meaningful ways. Further, we offer our users access to predictive models that compliment our data. You can visit this site publicly at https://stubenhancer.ca/.

  ## [Hash Length Extension Lab](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/MD5-Hash-Length-Extension-SEED-LAB/blob/main/Hash%20Length%20Extension%20Attack%20Lab.pdf)
When a client and a server want to communicate over the internet there is the risk of a Man in the Middle Attack (MITM). Thus, it is important that the server be proactive and validate the integrity of the request it receives from the client. The standard way to do this is by using a MAC and tagging that onto the end of   the request. MACs are generated from a secret key and the message, an insecure way to do this is to concatenate the key with the message and calculate the one-way   hash from that. This method allows an attacker to modify the message without knowing the secret key.

  <!--- MD5 collision pdf -->
  ## [MD5 Collision Lab](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/MD5-Collision-Attack-Seed-Lab/blob/main/MD5%20Collision%20Writeup.pdf)
The objective of this lab is to gain insight into the importance of the collision-resistance property of a hash. For a one-way hash function to be considered   secure there are several properties it must satisfy. The first is the one-way property; consider hash(M) = h. Given h it must be infeasible to find the input M.     The second one and the focus of this lab is the collision-resistance property. It must be computationally infeasible (cost more to do than the information is       worth) to find the hash of two different inputs equal. A collision occurs when this property is violated. i.e., Hash(M1) == Hash(M2). In this Lab we will take       advantage of this collision property (or lack thereof) to create two distinct programs that produce the same MD5 checksum (hash).

  ##[Enumerating the Corrosion 2 VulnHub Machine]()
    Using various enumeration tools, we succesfully gain access to the the server and escalate our privilege to that of root. The following video outlines the           *successful* steps we took https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRGzyZh4btQ (apologies for audio quality at some points).
