  ## [Hash Length Extension Lab](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/MD5-Hash-Length-Extension-SEED-LAB/blob/main/Hash%20Length%20Extension%20Attack%20Lab.pdf)
When a client and a server want to communicate over the internet there is the risk of a Man in the Middle Attack (MITM). Thus, it is important that the server   be proactive and validate the integrity of the request it receives from the client. The standard way to do this is by using a MAC and tagging that onto the end of   the request. MACs are generated from a secret key and the message, an insecure way to do this is to concatenate the key with the message and calculate the one-way   hash from that. This method allows an attacker to modify the message without knowing the secret key.

  ## [MD5 Collision Lab](https://github.com/LiamWRyan/MD5-Collision-Attack-Seed-Lab/blob/main/MD5%20Collision%20Writeup.pdf)
The objective of this lab is to gain insight into the importance of the collision-resistance property of a hash. For a one-way hash function to be considered   secure there are several properties it must satisfy. The first is the one-way property; consider hash(M) = h. Given h it must be infeasible to find the input M.     The second one and the focus of this lab is the collision-resistance property. It must be computationally infeasible (cost more to do than the information is       worth) to find the hash of two different inputs equal. A collision occurs when this property is violated. i.e., Hash(M1) == Hash(M2). In this Lab we will take       advantage of this collision property (or lack thereof) to create two distinct programs that produce the same MD5 checksum (hash).
